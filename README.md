# MARK-IT
‘MARK-IT’ is online marketing software designed using Turbo C++ 4.0. It is an interface between the retailers and consumers. Aimed at removing the commission of middle men, this software is equally useful for the retailers as well as the consumers.
  
Designed using arrays, structures and four files, this software gives the consumer a plethora of searching criteria, and provides the retailers the ease to update their stocks.  
Moreover, it creates a binary file for the retailers, but for the perusal of consumers, it generates a text file of the selected items along with the bill. The program also involves inheritance, providing a major advantage of code reusability.
